//Magic number is the if the sum of its digits recursively are calculated till
// a single digit If the single digit is 1 then the number is a magic number.
// Magic number is very similar with Happy Number.

//Example- 226 is said to be a magic number

//2+2+6=10 sum of digits is 10 then again 1+0=1 now we get a single digit 
//number is 1.if we single digit number will now 1 them it would  a magic number.
